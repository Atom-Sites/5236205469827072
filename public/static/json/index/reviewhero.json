      "Body": "Excellent service; driveway & patio look brand new! Very responsive to customer inquiries & received same day response + service. The young man who performed the work was very polite & performed the job efficiently; what took me six hours with my mini-washer he had done in a little over an hour and it looks so much better! Proper equipment works wonders. Power Pressure Wash is highly recommended & we will use them again in the future.",
